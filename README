PAES README
--------------------------

This is my Computer Science master degree's thesis!

PAES is an AES encryption tool that, thanks to OpenCL, can work both 
on CPUs and GPUs.

As you'll see in the directories list, this package contains both the software
and the thesis text and slides (both written in Italian). You should beware that
the thesis and the presentation refers to the first version of PAES and they
aren't strictly aligned with the program anymore. 




FILES
--------------------------
env.sh          script that sets the environment variables that makes
                AMD's OpenCL SDK to work; you'll surely need to modify
                it, if you want to use it.
